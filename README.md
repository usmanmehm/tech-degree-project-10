# Library Database Manager
## This app is an implementation of an intuitive database manager for a library. 
Doing CRUD operations on databases isn't always straightforward. First you have to know what you want to do, and then you have to be able to tell the database to do that. This requires knowledge of SQL along with an idea of the schema of the database. 

This app is designed to give users a visual interface for creating, reading, updating and deleting records for a library. The database has entries for books, patrons and what loans have been made. Entries can be created/updated/removed as needed for a user-friendly experience!
